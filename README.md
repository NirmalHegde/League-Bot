# Leauge-Bot
This bot is being made for my friend's discord server to allow them to find League of Legends stats at the click of a button. Requires the Puppeteer and Discord API.

All content utilized in this chatbot is based on content retreived from op.gg.

## How to use the bot

There are several commands that can be used with this chatbot, mostly surrounding things in League of Legends:



### `!roast [discord username]`

This function will extract an insult (all league of legends based) from an array at random and reply to the user being roasted using Discord API's `message.reply()` command:
